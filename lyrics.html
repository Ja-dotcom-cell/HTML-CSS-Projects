[Verse 1]
Like the words of a song, I hear you call
Like a thief in my head, you criminal
You stole my thoughts before I dreamed them
And you killed my queen with just one pawn

[Pre-Chorus]
This goodbye is no surprise
This goodbye won't make me cry

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll keep on dancin' until I'm dead
Dancin' until I'm dead, I'm dancin' until I'm dead
Yeah, I'll keep on dancin' until I'm dead (Dead)
I'll dance until I'm dead (Dead, dead, dead, dead)
'Cause when you killed me inside, that's when I came alive
Yeah, the music's gonna bring mе back from death
I'm dancin' until I'm dead (Dead)
I'll dancе until I'm dead (Dead, dead, dead, dead)

[Verse 2]
You've created a creature of the night
Now I'm haunting your air, your soul, your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
This goodbye is no surprise (Is no surprise)
This goodbye won't make me cry

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll keep on dancin' until I'm dead
Dancin' until I'm dead, I'm dancin' until I'm dead
Yeah, I'll keep on dancin' until I'm dead (Dead)
I'll dance until I'm dead (Dead, dead, dead, dead)
'Cause when you killed me inside, that's when I came alive
Yeah, the music's gonna bring me back from death
I'm dancin' until I'm dead (Dead)
I'll dance until I'm dead (Dead, dead, dead, dead)

[Bridge]
Do the dead dance (Dead)
The dead dance
Do the dead dance (Dead)
The dead dance
Do the dead dance (Dead)
The dead dance
Do the dead dance (Dead)
But l'm alive on the dance floor

[Chorus]
And I'm dancin' until I'm dead (Dead)
I'm dancin' until l'm dead, I'm dancin' until I'm dead
Yeah, I'll keep on dancin' until I'm dead (Dead)
I'll dance until I'm dead
'Cause when you killed me inside, that's when I came alive
Yeah, the music's gonna bring me back from death
I'm dancin' until I'm dead (Dead)
I'll dance until I'm dead

[Outro]
Dead (Dead, dead, dead, dead)
